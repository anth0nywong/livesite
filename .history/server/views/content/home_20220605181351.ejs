        <p>Motivated by the wish of making video games, I started to learn programming in mid 2021.<br><br>
            After a year of learning programming and game engines, I have the knowledge of Unity, Blende, Bootstrap and MEAN stack web developments.<br><br>
            The programming language that I use the most are C# and Typescript. I am a able to use them to solve medium level Leetcode challenges.<br><br>
